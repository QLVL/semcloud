The goal of semcloud is to process the output of the Python Workflow of
the Nephological Semantics project
(combining [nephosem](https://qlvl.github.io/nephosem)
and [semasioFlow](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow))
and prepare it to be
used with [NephoVis](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis).

## Installation

You can install the github development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud")
```

## Example

Instructions on how to go through the workflow can be found in a handful of
vignettes, available in the Articles section or by calling `vignette()`:

- `vignette('processClouds')` explains the steps from the output of
semasioFlow to the input of NephoVis;
- `vignette('weightConcordance')` shows how to create tailored contexts for Nephovis;
- `vignette('HDBSCAN')` shows how to implement HDBSCAN clustering on the models
and use the output to classify clouds (clusters).

To build vignettes when installing from GitHub run:

```r
remotes::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud", build_vignettes = T)
```
