The goal of semcloud is to process the output of the Python Workflow of
the Nephological Semantics project (combining
[nephosem](https://github.com/QLVL/nephosem/) and
[semasioFlow](https://github.com/montesmariana/semasioFlow)) and prepare
it to be used with [NephoVis](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis).

## Installation

You can install the github development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud")
```

## Example

You can find a notebook with the workflow this package is meant to
support as a vignette of the package. To access it, youâ€™ll have to
specify that vignettes must be built, or you can find it [in the
Articles
section](https://montesmariana.github.io/semcloud/articles/processClouds.html):

``` r
remotes::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud", build_vignettes = T)
vignette('processClouds', 'semcloud')
```

### Cloud classification

Based on the output from the code shown in the vignette, it is possible
to classify the clouds as shown in [Chapter 5 of Montes
(2021)](https://cloudspotting.montesmariana.me) by running the following
code:

``` r
models <- readRDS('/output/of/summarizeHDBSCAN')
ttmx_dir <- 'path/to/distance/matrices'

# For one model
lname <- names(models)[[1]]
mname <- names(models[[lname]]$medoidCoords)[[1]]

classifyModel(models[[lname]]$medoidCoords[[1]],
             names(models[[lname]]$medoidCoords)[[1]],
             file.path(ttmx_dir, lname))
             
# For all models, all lemmas
classification <- purrr::imap_dfr(models, function(ldata, lname){
    purrr::imap_dfr(models[[lname]]$medoidCoords, classifyModel,
    ttmx_dir = file.path(ttmx_dir, lname)) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(lemma = lname)
})
```
