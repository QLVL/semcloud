The goal of semcloud is to process the output of the Python Workflow of
the Nephological Semantics project (coming soon) and prepare it to be
used with [NephoVis](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis).

## Installation

You can install the github development version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud")
```

## Example

You can find a notebook with the workflow this package is meant to
support as a vignette of the package. To access it, youâ€™ll have to
specify that vignettes must be built:

``` r
devtools::install_github("montesmariana/semcloud", build_vignettes = T)
vignette('processClouds', 'semcloud')
```
