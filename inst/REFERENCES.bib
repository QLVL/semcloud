  abstract = {We propose a theoretically and practically improved density-based, hierarchical clustering method, providing a clustering hierarchy from which a simplified tree of significant clusters can be constructed. For obtaining a ``flat'' partition consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure, formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters, and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art, density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.},

  abstract = {This PhD study belongs to WP1 of the KU Leuven C1 research programme 'Nephological Semantics', (PI Dirk Geeraerts) which explores the use of distributional semantic methods for linguistic semantics. Specifically, the study aims at a realistic assessment of the possibilities and limitations of vector space semantics and word embeddings. The project will take the form of a number of case studies comparing polysemy analyses under three methods: a definitional lexicographical analysis, a 'behavioral profile' approach, and a semantic vector space approach. In general, the methodological goal of WP1 is to bring together a number of distributional methods that were developed in different contexts, and to refine, complement and systematize them, in order to turn them into an overarching, methodologically unified toolset in support of the analysis of various types of interplay between onomasiological, semasiological, and lectal variation. For validation and descriptive purposes, the methods are applied in case studies on English and Dutch lexical items.},

  title = {Visualizing {{Data}} Using T-{{SNE}}},
  author = {{van der Maaten}, Laurens and Hinton, Geoffrey},
  year = {2008},
  journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {2579--2605},
  abstract = {We present a new technique called ``t-SNE'' that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},
